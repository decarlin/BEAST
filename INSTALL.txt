Installation on a CentOS Linux Distro.

	MYSQL server:
		- install mysql server with yum or direct rpm source. Import the database from a dump
		mysql BEAST_dev < beast_dump.sql


	Install Apache:
		- check httpd running.
		- Add Listen beast.soe.ucsc.edu:80 to /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

	Open Firewall to allow connections for port 80:
		- append rule: 
			-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
		to /etc/sysconfig/iptables
		and then /etc/init.d/iptables restart

	Troubleshooting: 
		- try telneting through port 80 from another machine. If it's blocked, or if you 
		get a 'no route to host' error, the firewall (iptables is probably misconfigured)
	


	Installing GIT:	
	

		- Generate a ssh public key using ssh-keygen on the machine, then copy and paste the
		.pub file to github (import ssh keys).

	PERL Packages:

		- requires 5.8.x or later and DBI/DBD and SQL packages, along
		  with JSON.pm
